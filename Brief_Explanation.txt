The code given is for detecting communities in temporal networks using algorithms like Louvain, Leiden and Infomap. 
Some metrics, like Jaccard, JNR, LNR, Density, Relative Edges are also used in analyzing the change within the network along time and difference between these algorithms and the 
According to the code, the dataset should be in excel with the first row as "SRC, TGT, TIME"
